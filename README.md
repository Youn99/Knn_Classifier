# Knn_Classifier

Creating Knn Classifier Algorithm(using Eculidean Distance) without using sklearn.

K- Nearest Neighbours

This is a supervised machine learning algorithm, which is generally used to solve classification problems but sometimes it was also used in regression problems too. 
The main aim of KNN is to find the nearest neighbours of our query point. 
This algorithm believes that similar things are in close proximity, in other words, we can say that suppose X is +ve in a group of points so there is a high chance that the point nearer to X is also +ve.

We mostly use this distance measurement technique to find the distance between consecutive points. 
It is generally used to find the distance between two real-valued vectors. 
Euclidean distance is used when we have to calculate the distance of real values like integer, float, etcâ€¦ One issue with this distance measurement technique is that we have to normalize or standard the data into a balance scale otherwise the outcome will not preferable.
